### Prerequisites

Before proceeding with this guide, ensure that [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and the [Docker Compose plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/) are installed on your machine.
All commands were tested with Docker version 27.4.0 and Docker Compose version v2.30.3.

:::note
We encourage you to use a recent version of Docker and [Compose v2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/releases/migrate/) (however, Compose v1 might work with a few adaptions).
